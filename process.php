				<div class="col s12">
					<h3>High Fidelity Mockups and Prototypes</h3>
					<p>Apply product branding, grid structure, typography, color scheme, and icons.<br />
					Develop interactive prototypes with tools like Sketch or Invision.  This lets the team easily observe exactly how well the product will be received before the product gets built.  It gives the team a chance to see and take time to identify any roadblocks that haven’t been surfaced yet</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col s12">
					<h3>Pattern Library</h3>
					<p>Create a reusable pattern library in an app like Sketch so that you  and your team member do not have to keep recreating commonly used controls over and over again in your designs</p>
